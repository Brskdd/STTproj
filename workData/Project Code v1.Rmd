By comparing the r squared values for each variable's ability to predict how much the man likes the woman, we can conclude that the single best predictor is how attractive the man finds the woman, with an r squared value of .5171.

```{r Q3. Do larger age gaps affect if either a man or a woman view each other as attractive?}

  filter(!is.na(FunF)) %>%

```{r plotting men's view of women's attractiveness vs fun and their correlation.}

There appears to be a moderate positive correlation between how men view women as attractive vs how fun they view women.
To test this, we run a shuffle test to determine the significance of this correlation.


```{r Male shuffle test}
shuffleM <- function(male){
  shuffledM <- male %>%
    mutate(shuffled_AttractiveM = sample(AttractiveM, length(AttractiveM), replace=FALSE))
  
  return(cor(shuffledM$shuffled_AttractiveM, shuffledM$FunM, method = "pearson"))
}


nulldistM <- replicate(1000, shuffleM(speedDatingCleanedQ4))

boxplot(nulldistM, main = "Null Dist of How Men Percieve Women as Attractive vs Fun", horizontal = TRUE, ylim = c(-.25, .7), xlab = "Test Correlation Line (in red, = .6068)")
abline(v = CorM, col = "red")

p_valM <- mean(CorM <= nulldistM)
print(p_valM)
```
We reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between how men perceive women as attractive vs how they percieve them as fun at a = .05, because the p value is 0.

```{r testing the shuffle function. It is the same function for both Women and Men, just with different names.}
shuffleM <- function(male){
  shuffledM <- male %>%

  return(cor(shuffledM$shuffled_AttractiveM, shuffledM$FunM, method = "pearson"))
}

#Test 1: inputting a dataframe to shuffleM that contains no "AttractiveM" column. This should raise an error.
test1 <- speedDatingCleanedQ4 %>%
  select(FunM, FunF, AttractiveF)
shuffleM(test1$AttractiveM)

#Test 2: inputting a dataframe into shuffleM, where "AttractiveM" containes non numeric values. This should raise an error.
test2 <- speedDatingCleanedQ4 %>%
  mutate(AttractiveM = NA)
shuffleM(test2$AttractiveM)

#Test 3: replace "AttractiveM" with "FunM". this should raise an error
test3_output <- shuffleM(speedDatingCleanedQ4$FunM)
```

There appears to be a moderate positive correlation between how Women view Men as attractive vs how fun they view men.
To test this, we run a shuffle test to determine the significance of this correlation.

```{r Women shuffle test}
shuffleF <- function(female){
  shuffledF <- female %>%
    mutate(shuffled_AttractiveF = sample(AttractiveF, length(AttractiveF), replace=FALSE))
  
  return(cor(shuffledF$shuffled_AttractiveF, shuffledF$FunF, method = "pearson"))
}


nulldistF <- replicate(1000, shuffleF(speedDatingCleanedQ4))

boxplot(nulldistF, main = "Null Dist of How Women Percieve Men as Attractive vs Fun", horizontal = TRUE, ylim = c(-.25, .65), xlab = "Test Correlation Line (in red, = .5521)")
abline(v = CorF, col = "red")

p_valF <- mean(CorF <= nulldistF)
print(p_valF)
```

We reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between how women percieve men as attractive vs how they percieve them as fun at a = .05, because the p value is 0.
